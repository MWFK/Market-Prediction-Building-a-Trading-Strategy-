# Market-Prediction-Building-a-Trading-Strategies

##### I have created this repo during my participation in Jane Street Market Prediction hosted on Kaggle.
https://www.kaggle.com/c/jane-street-market-prediction

##### This repo is the fruit of a part-time effort, where I try to keep learning and improving my vision about the subject and developing code to test my findings and ideas.

##### I have created a reference for interesting notebooks that I have consulted/built my models around them, and detailed references are provided within each notebook.

##### I have kept some of my work private on both Kaggle and Github since it's ongoing work.

##### Some of my publicly shared notebooks are experimental, incomplete, or have faults, so please try to consider that, and hopefully it can help you.
